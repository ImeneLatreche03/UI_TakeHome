# UI_TakeHome


-This repository is for the UI TakeHomeExercise

-I have used:
	Java programming language,
	Selenium WebDriver for UI testing
	TestNG for the assertions and annotations.

-All the dependencies are provided on the POM.

-The framework is implemented with POM: the page classes are under "src\main\java\pageLayers"

-The test class "SearchProduct" is  under "src\test\java\SearchProduct.java"
  It contains 3 Tests dependant to each other:
  	Test1 will searchTheProduct and confirm it is present.
  	Test2 will choose the correct product and add it to the cart.
	Test3 will verify if the product is added to cart.

-An extent report is generated at the end of my automation testing
